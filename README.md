# Linear-Regression

This Program uses a Machine Learning model (linear regression) to identify another dataset that is nonexistent through being trained to understand the data. the parameters I have set should allow you to get a pretty high accuracy of around 96%+ and the maxmium I got was around 97.5%. You can adjust the data or read it and understand what the code is doing that's up to you.

Enjoy!
